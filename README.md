## Tips for other job searchers
 - Try to make this presentation at the beginning of the interview, in the "tell me about yourself" section. 
 - I would recommend presenting slides 2 and 5 and mentioning that you have demos and more info about you if they would like to see.
 - If you can, leave the presentation open to use the cases in "tell me about a time when..."
 - At the end of the meeting, send the presentation by e-mail.
